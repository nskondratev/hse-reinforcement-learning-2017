This is a simple game in python which can be played by both human player and an AI Player. AI has been trained via neural network reinforcement learning. See [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_h13nDa6_E)

## Usage:
Run RunGame.py to start playing, select the options and Human vs AI player (AI pre train vs AI post train choice at game run selects from 'dumb' pre-train and 'smart' post-train AI).
